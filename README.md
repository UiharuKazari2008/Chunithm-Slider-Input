# Chunithm-Slider-Input
Use an official ground slider on Chunithm to interact with a PC.

This is not and will not work to play the game on a PC. It is designed to be used when the cabinet is in standby and provide input to another PC.

Based on ChunithmIO's [slidertest.py](https://github.com/CrazyRedMachine/ChunithmIO/tree/main/slidertest) and migrated to NodeJS. Thank you for saving me many hours of my day!
